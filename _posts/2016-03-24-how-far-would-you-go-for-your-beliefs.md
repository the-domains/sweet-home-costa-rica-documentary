**_Sweet Home Costa Rica_** looks at a group of ordinary American families who, when faced with an intolerable threat to their religious freedom and antiwar beliefs, found the courage not only to stand up to the U.S. Government but to turn and walk away. They went farther than most. And they never looked back.

The film tells the story of eleven Quaker families from
Alabama whose search for peace, 
religious freedom and a less materialistic environment in which to 
raise their children led them to a cloud forest in northwestern Costa 
Rica as beautiful as it was remote. There were no roads, no schools, no 
electricity. They named their new home Monteverde, literally "Green 
Mountain," and set about rebuilding their lives and putting their faith 
and pacifism into practice. Today Monteverde is home to a thriving 
Friends School (est. 1951) and several biological research institutes and is considered a model for sustainable ecotourism.
