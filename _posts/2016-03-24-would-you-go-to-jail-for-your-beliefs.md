_"I felt that in registering \[for the draft\] I was indirectly 
sanctioning
war and I did not wish to do that... I feel that it is my duty to try 
to show as many people as possible how wrong war is and to show a way 
through love of combating this wrong which we have."_

_--_Marvin Rockwell of Fairhope, Ala., to US                                                                         District Judge John McDuffie, Oct. 1949
